# Resource_collection
In this webpage, we can find collection of few important links for quick access, mainly to students.
## Cause for this project
Before we start working on one thing, we spend most of our time in searching for resources. Due to this we will lose much time. At some times we keep on searching for resources throughout the day.
And if we find a best  and useful sites, we immediately  bookmark those sites. But all the bookmarked sites will be mixed up, which over the time becomes difficult to find link of the required site.
## This project is about
This is a small project to overcome above issues.
In this "Resource collection" webpage we can find the links of most commenly used sites, in a proper and systamatic order.
Through this we can reduce our time and effort in search of required sites.
